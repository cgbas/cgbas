I have a solid career as a Systems Engineer, passionate about reusability, DevOps/SRE and scalable, cloud-native workflows. The Software Engineering aspect was something that I always worked on the sides but recentlty I've enrolled in a graduate program in Java Architecture and Entreprise Development, so decoupled architectures, DDD, serverless, event-driven, microservices, and last but not least (at all!) API related content will pop up a lot around here.

I've got experience leading technical leaders, creating a healthy 1:1 culture and helping others evolve into their best professional versions through career development plans, constantly revisiting team topologies and PDCA cycles or defining meaningful deliverable roadmaps.

With over 16 years in the IT industry, most of them working with middleware solutions, automating infrastructure provisioning through a number of vendors and mission critical environments, I had the chance to manage and improve workloads of several companies in Brazil, US, and UK as an offshore consultant. Always striving for knowledge sharing and fighting against silos of all kinds.
